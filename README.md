# Multilingual Online Translator

### About
The program supports 13 languages. The program will ask the user to choose a 
language they want to translate from, then a language they want to translate to
(the user will also have the option to translate to all languages other than 
the original one), then the word they want to be translated.
After that, five possible translations and 5 examples that contain the word of 
interest will be outputted on the console, in addition to being saved to a file.

### Learning Outcomes
You will learn to work with loops and conditions, pip, and packages. You'll take 
a closer look at web scraping, and learn a bit of HTML and CSS. You'll find out 
how to handle exceptions and work with an HTTP connection.  Youâ€™ll be talking 
to the web with requests and handling the data with the BeautifulSoup library.
